<h1>Celia DTB Validator</h1>

E-book and audiobook validation tool

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h3>What does the Celia DTB Validator do?</h3>

<p>The Celia DTB Validator analyses files for their digital peak level, true peak (ISP) level,  signal-to-noise ratio and LUFS. Validator also looks for unexpected silences in files and checks that there is silence at end of file and no silence at start of file. <br />
  If examined book is Daisy it is also possible to validate book using Daisy Pipeline Validator light.  It is also possible to encode audio of a Daisy book to mp3 using Daisy Pipeline.</p>

<h3>Validations performed</h3>

<h4>Audiofile validations</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Lufs, pkdb, tpkdb, snr levels are in valid range
  <li> Lufs does not change noticeably between two files
  <li> There is enough silence at end of file
  <li> There is not too much silence at end of file
  <li> There is sound at beginning of file
  <li> There are no unexpected silences at middle of file
</ul>

<h4>Daisy validations</h4>

<ul>
  <li> ncc.html file exist
  <li> smil-files exist
  <li> filename prefix matches dc:identifier
  <li> Number of smil files is same as number of audio files
  <li> master.smil file exists
  <li> Only one phrase in the first heading
  <li> ncc.html encoded to certain character encoding
  <li> Metadata fields not left empty
  <li> Page numbers not found at first phrase of heading
  <li> Daisy pipeline 1 Daisy 2.02 Validator light validation
</ul>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

<p>Celia DTB Validator is designed to work on Windows 10, using Python 3.8.7. (newer python3 versions should also work)</p>

<p>For audio and Daisy validation it is required that following programs are also installed:</p>

<ul>
  <li> <strong>Python 3.8.7</strong> (or newer)
  <li> <strong>FFmpeg 4.4</strong> (or newer)
    <ul>
      <li>FFmpeg might also require aditional modules tobe installed in order for them to be able to work with files in mp3 format (or flac, ogg, ...). <br />
        Mp3 support has not been tested while development as the program is primarily meant as validating wav files. <br />
        Please refer to documentation provided by FFmpeg for more information.</li>
    </ul>
  <li> <strong>Daisy Pipeline 1 v. 20111215</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If validation is done for audio only, Daisy Pipeline is not required.
      </li>
    </ul>
  <li> <strong>Java JRE 11</strong> (should install automatically when installing Pipeline?) (note: in test environment we use AdoptOpenJDK Java JRE 8, and it also does work)
    <ul>
      <li>
        If validation is done for audio only, Java is not required.
      </li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<p>Please refer to the documentation of the programs mentioned for more information on installation and usage.</p>

    git clone https://github.com/celiafi/celiadtbvalidator.git
</pre>

<p>Archived older releases can be downloaded as zip from releases page</p>

<img src="img/github3.png">

<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>For installation of Celia DTB Validator the files can be placed in any location.</p>

<p>Celia DTB Validator is written in pure Python3 and does not require any additionalPython modules to run. Usage of virtualenv is always a good practise, but it is not really needed here as there are no additional third party python modules needed.</p>


<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>For basic usage use validator_gui.py to run Celia DTB Validator GUI.</p>

<p>For advanced usage use celia_dtb_validator.py from cmd or Powershell.</p>

<h3>Key concepts</h3>

<p>These are the key consepts in Celia DTB Validators usage:</p>

<p>
<b>Input path:</b><br />  
Path to the folder containing book to be validated  <br />
<b>Output path:</b><br />  
Path to folder where encoded book is placed (if audio encoding is enabled)  <br />
<b>Report path:</b><br />  
Path to folder where validation report is stored  <br />
<b>Config file:**  </b><br />
File where all variables (for example valid LUFS values etc.) can be set and where audio and daisy validations and audio encoding can be enabled/disabled. Config file is located on the same folder as the file celia_dtb_validator.py.
</p>

<h3>Graphical user interface</h3>

<img src="img/gui_img1.jpg" width="1000" height="357">

<p>Minimalistic GUI enables user to define all paths, open the config file for editing and to start the validation.</p>

<p>Validation output is shown on Python3 prompt. After validation is finished the report is shown in usersdefault webbrowser.</p>

<img src="img/gui_img2.jpg">

<p>After examining the report the user can then decide wheter or not to proceed with audio encoding.</p>

<img src="img/gui_img3.jpg" width="1000" height="357">

<h3>Command line interface</h3>

<p>Command line interface can be run with following command:</p>

<pre>
    python celia_dtb_validator.py -i BOOKPATH [-o OUTPUTPATH] [-r REPORTPATH]
</pre>

<p>There is also parameter -h to print basic usage info and -v to print version number.</p>


<p><b>NOTE ON PATHS WITH SPACES:</b><br /> 
If you use paths with spaces you should leave out the last backslash. The last backslash will be interpreted as escape character. Use 'C:\Temp\Path With Spaces' instead of 'C:\Temp\Path With Spaces\'  <br />
You can also use double quotes ie. "'C:\Temp\Path With Spaces\'", or use forward slahes instead, ie. 'C:/Temp/Path With Spaces/'</p>

<h3>Configuration</h3>

<p>All setting can be configured using the config.txt file.</p>

<p>Following configurations can be set:</p>

<ul>
  <li> audio validation (on/off)
  <li> daisy validation (on/off)
  <li> open reports after validation (on/off)
  <li> encode audio (on/off)
  <li> target kbps
  <li> target text encoding
  <li> lufs min
  <li> lufs max
  <li> pkdb min
  <li> pkdb max
  <li> tpkdb min
  <li> tpkdb max
  <li> snr min
  <li> silence db
  <li> end silence min
  <li> end silence max
  <li> start silence max
  <li> mid silence max
  <li> max volume level flux
  <li> pipeline path
  <li> FFmpeg path
  <li> java path
</ul>

<p>Please see <i>config.txt</i> for more information.</p>

<p>Note: If you mess up your configuration file a new one is generated automatically, if you delete or rename the current config.txt file.</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<h4>Daisy production example</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Record book as usual.
  <li>Regenerate book using book id as file name prefix (optional)
  <li>Change dc:identifier on (regenerated) books ncc.html to book id  
   (optional - dc:identifier is used as mp3 encoded books foldername  
   (if empty folder is named as 'mp3'))  
  <li>Run validation on (regenerated) book using folowing configurations  
    audio_validation = 1  
    daisy_validation = 1  
    encode_audio = 1  
    target_kbps = 64 (or some other value)  
  <li>Examine validation report
  <li>Validator ask if you wish to continue with audio encoding  
    if there are errors -> answer no and fix them on original book and do steps 2-5 again  
    if no errors are found -> answer 'y'  
  <li>After encoding the encoded audio book is in output-folders
</ol>


<h4>Daisy and audio validation example</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Run validation on any Daisy book using folowing configurations  
    audio_validation = 1  
    daisy_validation = 1  
    encode_audio = 0  
  <li>Examine validation report  
    if there are errors -> fix/report them etc.
</ol>

<h4>Mp3 playlist audiobook audio validation</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Record audio and generate playlist as usual
  <li>Run validation on folder containing audio files using folowing configurations:  
    audio_validation = 1  
    daisy_validation = 0  
    encode_audio = 0 (optional -> disabling daisy validations automatically disables audio encoding)  
  <li>Examine validator report  
    if there are errors -> fix errors and do steps 1-3 again
</ol>

<h4>Batch validate all daisy books in a folder</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Put all books in one folder
  <li>Use folowing configurations:  
    audio_validation = 1  
    daisy_validation = 1  
    encode_audio = 0  
  <li>Run following Powershell command:  
    $dtbs = ls -Directory -Path PATHTOFOLDER | % { $_.FullName } ; foreach ($dtb in $dtbs) {python PATHTOVALIDATOR\celia_dtb_validator.py -i $dtb -r PATHTOFOLDER}  
  <li>Reports are opened into default webbrowser in tabs and stored into PATHTOFOLDER.
</ol>
